            Dubai is a city in the United Arab Emirates known for luxury
            shopping, ultramodern architecture, and a lively nightlife scene.
            Burj Khalifa, an 830m tall tower, dominates the skyscraper-filled
            skyline. At its base lies Dubai Fountain, with jets and lights
            choreographed to music.

            The city is also known for its extravagant hotels, such as the Burj
            Al Arab, which is shaped like a sail and sits on an artificial
            island. Dubai's shopping scene includes the Dubai Mall, one of the
            largest malls in the world, featuring an aquarium and an indoor ice
            rink.
